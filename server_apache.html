		<h1>CORS on Apache</h1>
    <p>The easiest way to CORS authorization on an Apache webserver is to include the following lines in an <code>.htaccess</code> file at the website's root directory:</p>
		
		<pre class="code">
&lt;IfModule mod_headers.c&gt;
  Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
&lt;/IfModule&gt;</pre>

   If no <code>.htaccess</code> file exists, simply create a new one.  If an <code>.htaccess</code> file already exists, make a backup of it and then add the above lines.  Finally, <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/stopping.html">reload Apache</a> to make sure your changes are applied:</p>
 <pre>sudo service apache2 reload</pre> 
 or <pre>apachectl -k graceful</pre>
   
   <p> You can also add the above lines to <code>&lt;Directory&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;Location&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;Files&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</code> sections of your <a href="https://wiki.apache.org/httpd/DistrosDefaultLayout">server config</a>. Also note that you can also use <code>add</code> rather than <code>set</code>, but be aware that <code>add</code> can add the header multiple times, so it's likely safer to use set.</p>

 <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
 
<p>It is strongly reccomended that you backup your original file and test your new config before applying:</p>
    
    <pre class="code">apachectl configtest</pre>
    
<p> If you run into errors, restore your backup configuration files and run <code>apachectl configtest</code> again. If your config files run without error, ensure that you have copied everything exactly and that the <code>Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"</code> line  is in the correct place.</p>
  
 <p class="note">Altering headers requires the use of <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_headers.html">mod_headers</a>. Mod_headers is enabled by default in Apache, however, you may want to ensure it's enabled by running <code>a2enmod headers</code> on the command line.</p>
